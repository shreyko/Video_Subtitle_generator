# Video_Subtitle_generator
Overlay subtitles on any video using Python, openCV, and speech recognition 

The Python file is capable of overlaying subtitles after generation on any video. Both the subtitle generation and overlaying are done locally.
Most of the dependencies can be installed using pip, for more reference refer to: https://pypi.org/

The code creates a CSV file with timestamps and the associated subtitles at that timestamp and then uses OpenCV to overlay the text on the video.
The final version is stored as final_video.mp4 inside the same folder.

### Future of this project
I would like to add better Natural language processing models to make the subtitle generation more accurate and efficient.
